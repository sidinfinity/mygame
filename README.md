Learning python small games

This repo contains games I wrote to learn python.
credit goes to kids can code .org.

Some of the images are from open game art .org.
I will state the artist in the code.

Some of the code I copied from various youtube tutorials.

Some of the code I developed myself.

NOTE: If you are using Mac OS Mojave you are out of luck.
Pygame has an issue w/ Mojave and python3.7. Works best w/ High Sierra.

Created a new branch called "feature".
This is used to develop a new game.
